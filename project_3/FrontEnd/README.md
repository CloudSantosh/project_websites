### README.md for Movie Directory Web Application

This repository contains a simple web application that fetches and displays a list of popular movies from The Movie Database (TMDb). It also provides functionality for searching movies based on user input. This project is ideal for understanding the integration of external APIs in a front-end application and handling dynamic content with JavaScript.

#### Features

- **Display Popular Movies**: Automatically fetches and displays popular movies on page load.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for movies using the TMDb API.
- **Responsive Design**: Includes basic responsive design features that adjust layout elements based on the screen size.

#### Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For styling the content.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For dynamic content management and API integration.
- **TMDb API**: For fetching movie data.

#### Setup and Running Locally

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-directory.git
   cd movie-directory
   ```

2. **Obtain API Key**

   - Sign up or log in to [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and obtain your API key.
   - Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` in `script.js` with your actual TMDb API key.

3. **Launch the Application**

   - Open `index.html` in your browser to view the application.

#### Usage

- **Viewing Popular Movies**: Simply load the webpage to see the popular movies displayed dynamically.
- **Searching for Movies**: Enter a movie name in the search bar at the top and press enter or click the submit button to fetch search results.

#### Dependencies

- **TMDb API**: The application relies on the TMDb API for fetching all movie data. Ensure that you have a valid API key configured in `script.js`.

#### Future Improvements

- **Pagination**: Implement pagination to view additional movie results.
- **Advanced Search Options**: Add filters for genre, year, etc., to enhance search capability.
- **Detailed Movie Information**: On clicking a movie, show more detailed information in a modal or new page.
- **Better Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling for network requests and user feedback.
